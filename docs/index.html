  <h1 class="display-4">Queen</h1>
  <p class="lead">Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals and piano), Brian May (lead guitar and vocals), Roger Taylor (drums and vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music.</p>

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p class="lead">In 1968, Brian May was at college.</p>

         <p> He decided to make a band and teamed up with two other college students called Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves "Smile" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. </p> <p>They did a few hits such as "April Lady". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of "Smile" and encouraged them a lot. </p> <p> Later on, Tim left "Smile" to join "Humpy Bong" and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano. </p> <p>Then Farrokh came up with the name "Queen", so they changed it from "Smile" to "Queen". They then started auditions for a new bassist. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. </p> <p> Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called "Queen" with songs such as "Seven Seas Of Rhye" and "Liar". </p> <p> Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics "Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me" in "My Fairy King". </p>
